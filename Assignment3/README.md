# Assignment 3

In this assignment I worked on three problems involving NHANES data analysis, SQL database queries, and Australian dataset manipulation.

**Problem 1**
* Downloaded and merged audiometry and demographics datasets from NHANES 2015-2016.
* Cleaned four demographic variables by converting coded values to factors and handling missing data.
* Resolved household income ordering issue by excluding overlapping categories.
* Fitted four Poisson regression models predicting tympanometric width for right and left ears.
* Calculated incidence risk ratios and model statistics for all models.
* Conducted Wald test and likelihood ratio test on Model 2L to test for gender differences.

**Problem 2**
* Analyzed customer and staff data using both SQL+R and pure SQL approaches.
* Calculated store-level customer statistics and activity rates.
* Identified staff members and their countries through multi-table joins.
* Found films rented at the highest dollar value using payment data.
* Benchmarked performance showing pure SQL queries were significantly faster.

**Problem 3**
* Analyzed website domain extensions and email domains.
* Examined non-alphabetic characters in company names.
* Reformatted phone numbers from landline to cell phone format.
* Extracted apartment numbers and created histogram of log-transformed values.
* Applied Benford's Law test showing apartment numbers have uniform distribution, suggesting non-real data.

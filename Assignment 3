### Assignment 3

In this assignment I worked on three problems.  

**Problem 1**  
- Downloaded and merged audiometry (AUX_I) and demographics (DEMO_I) datasets from NHANES 2015-2016 using inner join, resulting in 4,582 matched records.
- Cleaned four demographic variables (gender, citizenship status, number of children, household income) by converting coded values to readable factors and handling missing data appropriately.
- Identified and resolved the ordering issue in household income categories where overlapping ranges needed to be excluded.
- Fitted four Poisson regression models predicting tympanometric width in right and left ears using gender alone and with additional covariates (citizenship, number of children, income).
- Created tables presenting incidence risk ratios, confidence intervals, p-values, and model statistics (sample size, Pseudo R², AIC).
- Conducted statistical tests on Model 2L using Wald test and likelihood ratio test to examine gender differences in tympanometric width.
- Compared predicted values between males and females, finding that females have significantly higher tympanometric width.

**Problem 2**  
- Connected to the Sakila SQLite database and analyzed customer and staff data using both SQL+R and pure SQL approaches.
- Calculated customer statistics by store.
- Identified staff members and their countries using multiple table joins (staff → address → city → country).
- Found films rented at the highest dollar value.
- Benchmarked performance differences between SQL+R and pure SQL approaches.

**Problem 3**  
- Loaded the Australian 500-record dataset and analyzed website domains.
- Extracted email domains and found hotmail.com as most common.
- Analyzed non-alphabetic characters in company names.
- Reformatted all phone numbers from landline format (02-1234-5678) to cell phone format (0212-345-678).
- Extracted apartment numbers from addresses and created a histogram of log-transformed values.
- Applied Benford's Law to apartment number first digits.

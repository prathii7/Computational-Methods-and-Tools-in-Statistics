#### Assignment 1

In this assignment I worked on three problems.  

**Problem 1: Abalone Data**  
- Imported the abalone dataset into R and added proper column names from the names file.  
- Reported counts of each sex in the data.  
- Found which weight has the highest correlation with number of rings and checked it by sex.  
- Found the weights for the abalone with the most rings.  
- Calculated percentage of abalones where viscera weight is more than shell weight.  
- Made a table of correlations between weights and rings by sex.  
- Carried out t-tests to compare number of rings across sexes and interpreted the results.  

**Problem 2: Food Expenditure Data**  
- Imported the survey data into R.  
- Cleaned variable names to make them simple.  
- Kept only rows with USD payments and checked the number of observations before and after.  
- Cleaned age, state, food expenditure, and dining out variables by setting my own rules for removing bad rows.  
- Reported the final number of observations after cleaning.  

**Problem 3: Collatz Conjecture**  
- Wrote a function `nextCollatz` to calculate the next number in the Collatz sequence.  
- Wrote a function `collatzSequence` to return the full sequence and its length.  
- Tested the functions on given examples to show they work.  
- Found the shortest and longest Collatz sequences between 100 and 500 and reported the starting values.

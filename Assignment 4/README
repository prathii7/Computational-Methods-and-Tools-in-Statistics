# Assignment 4

This assignment involved three problems: New Zealand election results analysis using the tidyverse, ATP tennis match outcomes using tidyverse and infer, and COVID-19 case visualization using New York Times data.

---

## **Problem 1 — New Zealand Election Data**

* Loaded NZ election dataset and summarized vote counts by **election year and voting type (Candidate vs Party)**.
* For the 2014 election, calculated each party’s share of the total Candidate votes and ranked parties by vote percentage.
* Identified, for every election year, the **winning party under both ballot types** by grouping, aggregating vote totals, and selecting the maximum.
* Reformatted results into a comparison table showing **which party won Candidate votes vs Party votes each year.**

## **Problem 2 — ATP Tennis (2019 Season Data)**

* Filtered ATP match dataset to 2019 and counted total tournaments held.

* Isolated tournament finals to determine how many tournaments each player won.

* Used a permutation hypothesis test with the *infer* package (no base R functions) to assess whether **winners hit more aces than losers**:

  * Generated null distribution via label permutation
  * Computed p-value from simulated null distribution

## **Problem 3 — COVID-19 Case Visualization (NYTimes Rolling Averages)**

Used U.S. state-level rolling-average datasets to create publication-quality visualizations addressing three questions:

1. **How many major/minor spikes occurred nationally?**

2. **How do trends differ between the highest-rate and lowest-rate states?**

3. **Which states experienced substantial outbreaks first?**

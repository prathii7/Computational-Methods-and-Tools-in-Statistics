This repository contains the final project for STATS 506, examining temporal changes in the association between obesity and self-reported happiness in the United States using General Social Survey (GSS) data from 2014 and 2018. The analysis applies ordinal logistic regression with three-way interactions to assess whether trends differ by education and household income, adjusting for key demographic covariates. Results highlight income-specific divergence in obesity-related happiness over time, with a growing disadvantage observed among middle-income individuals.
